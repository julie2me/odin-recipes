  <h2>History of the Sea Breeze</h2>

  <p>The cranberry grower's cooperative in the 1930s evolved into Ocean Spray which marketed cranberry juice in the 1950s.[4] Cranberry juice was used as a mixer with alcohol, first with gin and later with vodka.[4] The Harpoon, later called the Cape Codder, was born, and its descendants such as the Greyhound, the Salty Dog, the Bay Breeze, and the Sea Breeze were later created.[4] Starting in the 1960s, the breeze drinks were sporadically in the top ten most popular mixed drinks.[4]

    According to some, the Sea Breeze, along with the Cape Codder and Bay Breeze, did not become very popular until the 1970s.[7] This was because in 1959, the U.S. Department of Health stated that cranberry crops were tainted with toxic herbicides, collapsing the cranberry industry.[7] </p>
