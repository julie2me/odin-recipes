This is the Recipe website project from The Odin Project (TOP). The project is designed entirely with html. The project displays a homepage with 3 links to recipes. Each link opens onto a child page with that recipe. Each recipe page contains an image , an unordered list of the ingredients, an ordered list of the recipe steps.
